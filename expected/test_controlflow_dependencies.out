 * The purpose of this test file is a bit different than other test files;
 * we are not checking anywhere that the rollups created are correct;
 * instead, we are only checking that there are no errors when generating/using the rollup;
 * this will ensure that all the column dependencies are satisfied.
 * We are not trying trying to check that the dependencies for a particular type are satisfied,
 * but rather that the dependency checker is working;
 * therefore, there is no need to modify this file when adding a new algebra.
